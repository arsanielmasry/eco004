        <p>Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and designed to have as few
        implementation dependencies as possible</p>

        <p>Why learning java ?? </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Java is Easy to learn</li>
            <li>Java is an Object-Oriented Programming Language</li>
            <li>Powerful development tools e.g., Eclipse, Netbeans</li>
        </ul>
